<div class="text-block2"> The main interest in my life is hiking and travelling. My family and I explored the entire state of Washington and visited a lot of interesting and beautiful places. 
One of our favorite places is Leavenworth. This is a small, lovely town bult in the Bavarian style with a lot of restaurants serving German beer and food. Hundreds of tourists visit it every day, regardless of the weather. 
 Also, my family and I have been in Canada. One of the most interesting places for visit is Capilano Suspension Bridge Park. This amazing place need to be visited by everyone who travels to Canada. It will be remembered for a long time. 
 Recently I found a new hobby, it is yoga. Yoga balances the physical and mental state of the body. It helps to escape from problems, to achieve inner harmony and tranquility.
