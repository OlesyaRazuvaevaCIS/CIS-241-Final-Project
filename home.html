<div class="text-block2"> Hi! Welcome to my website! My name is Olesya. I am an accountant with 13-year of experience. Recently I decided to change my profession.  I found the Edmonds College. My choice fell on a Web Application and Cloud Developer course.  
Before going to the college, I was trying to learn HTML and CSS by myself. And I realized that this profession is very interesting for me. I hope that one day I will work as a backend developer. 
In my spare time I like to be with my family. Our favorite pastime is watching movies together. Also, we like to cook. My son finds new recipes on YouTube  and we try to cook them together.</div>
